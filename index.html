<P>Many players struggle to find the right gameplay style and training exercises that suit them, not only in Valorant in particular but in other FPS shooter games such as CsGO, FPS Chess, and Overwatch.
This guide is directed to teach new and less experienced players on how to improve and be a team player.
Personally, as a <Strong>top #7k in CRK, level 190 in Arsenal, and being friends with multiple top 500 Radiant/Ex-Pro players</Strong> in Valorant, I will give you the best advice on how to rank up and improve your crusty icky aim in an in-depth guide.
<Strong>WELCOME TO AWAKE'S VALORANT GUIDE :)</Strong></P>
